1. Initializing the JavaScript runtime and creating an execution context.
2. Running scripts and handling values.
3. Printing out script results.

2. Open **HelloWorld.sln** with Visual Studio.
3. Copy the headers and lib to the sample project's directory, and copy **ChakraCore.dll** to the sample project's output directory. 
4. Build the sample by pressing  **F6**  or using  **Build > Build Solution**.
